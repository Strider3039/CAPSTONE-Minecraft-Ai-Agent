Minecraft AI Agent (Capstone Project)
This project explores building an AI agent that can take the place of a player in Minecraft. Using Python and Q-learning, the agent learns how to interact with the world step by step â€” starting with simple tasks like moving, collecting wood, and surviving. A custom Java Forge plugin connects Python to Minecraft, letting the AI see the game state and send actions back.

In the second phase, a website will explain the full process so others can follow along and create their own Minecraft agent.
