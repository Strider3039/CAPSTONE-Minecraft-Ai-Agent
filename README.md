# Minecraft AI Agent (Capstone & Learning Project)

This project is about creating an AI agent that can take the place of a player in Minecraft. The agent is built in Python using Q-learning, with a custom Java Forge plugin that connects the AI to the Minecraft world.

The goal isn’t just to make a working bot; the code is open and public, so anyone can use it, modify it, and learn from it. Alongside the bot, we’re building a website that explains the process step by step, making it easier for others to explore how reinforcement learning works in practice and experiment with their own Minecraft agents.
